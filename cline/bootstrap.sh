# Cline harness bootstrap — runs ONCE on first boot, as root, cwd /root/workspace, sh.
#
# WHY NO COMMITTED SEED CONFIG (cline is the contract's documented exception):
# Every other harness commits a real, version-controlled config file with
# __TRIBES_*__ placeholders that bootstrap.sh seds. Cline has none — its
# provider config is produced by the `cline auth openai-compatible ...` CLI
# command, which writes cline's OWN provider file (~/.cline/data/settings/
# providers.json) at runtime from the live proxy/token/model. That command
# needs the `cline` binary plus runtime creds, so it is inherently runtime and
# there is no static file to commit (no heredoc to convert to a seed file).
#
# Installs the Cline CLI ONLY. The `cline auth` command that writes the provider
# file is NOT here — it lives in launch.sh and runs EVERY boot, so each launch
# re-auths with a live provider placeholder (the platform-provided OpenRouter placeholder; a stale token baked
# at first boot would otherwise 401 after a restore). Cline has no env-based proxy
# config and no theme support (hardcoded palette).

# Cache the PLACEHOLDER-BEARING primer + the renderer outside the workspace, then
# render. Bootstrap runs ONCE and its sed consumes the placeholders, so stamping
# them here alone froze the wrong values for the life of the disk: the guest's
# hostname is the boot slug (a claim never renames the VM), and a box bootstrapped
# before its identity row is bound has no TRIBES_IDENTITY_* and froze "none".
# launch.sh re-runs the renderer every launch so both self-heal.
# DRIVE-FIRST, same gate the skills install below uses. The shared read-only
# /opt/harnesses drive bakes the WHOLE template tree at the pinned ref
# (dockers/Dockerfile.harnesses in tribes-protocol/terminal), so a stock boot
# copies the primer + renderer off the drive and touches no network. The curl
# runs only when the drive predates templates (old image, dev backend) or when a
# pinned TRIBES_HARNESS_REF (QA) must exercise that ref's own primer.
#
# Behaviour change, intended: a stock box now gets the PINNED primer instead of
# whatever is on `main`. TRIBES_HARNESS_REF is unset in this env on stock boxes,
# so the curl below was resolving REF to `main` while the template itself was
# pinned — the primer floated. A hotfix pushed to `main` now needs a pin bump +
# drive rebake to reach stock boxes.

# --- platform-funded config: see launch.sh -------------------------------------
# The `cline auth openai-compatible ...` command that writes cline's provider
# file (~/.cline/data/settings/providers.json) is deliberately in launch.sh, NOT
# here: it must re-run on EVERY boot so a RESTORE picks up the refreshed token
# (running it once here would leave a restored box authed with the revoked key).

# --- safety net -------------------------------------------------------------
# Belt-and-suspenders: no file under /root/workspace may survive with a raw
# __TRIBES_* placeholder. cline has no committed seed config (auth is a runtime
# command), so this is a no-op guard. AGENTS.md only carries __HOST__ and __EMAIL__ (both filled above), so it is
# not matched.
# NEVER delete *.sh — bootstrap.sh/launch.sh legitimately contain __TRIBES_ in
# their sed patterns/fallbacks; only NON-script files with a raw placeholder are
# broken config and get removed.

# boot runs the baked copy and needs no network for skills. The installer is
# fetched only when the drive predates skills (old image, dev backend) or a

# Runs after all config writes; fully tolerant, so it never blocks or fails
